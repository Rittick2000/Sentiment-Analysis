Life is filled with happiness, sadness, tears, smiles, laughter and other emotions: but when life gets you down, be strong and have faith. Sometimes you may be happy and sometimes be sad; that is the way of life. Sadness reminds us of the importance of happiness in our life. Sadness gives us the opportunity to ask for change and offer a better way of living.
